 # Diamond Price Prediction using Machine Learning, with full end-to-end deployment on AWS. 🚀

In the dynamic realm of data science, practical application is key. Our project is a testament to this ethos, as we seamlessly integrated cutting-edge techniques with real-world industry demands:

🔎 Exploration & Dataset Curation: We embarked on a deep dive into the world of diamonds, meticulously curating a dataset enriched with key features influencing prices.

🛠️ Model Development & Training: Leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms, we engineered predictive models capable of forecasting diamond prices with exceptional accuracy.

🔧 AWS Deployment: Transitioning from development to deployment, AWS provided the perfect platform for scalability and efficiency, ensuring our models are readily accessible to stakeholders.

🚀 GitHub Actions & Docker: Streamlining our workflow was imperative. GitHub Actions facilitated seamless integration and deployment, while Docker ensured consistency across environments, optimizing our development process.

🌟 Key Learnings: Our project underscores the transformative potential of data science in traditional industries. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, we unlock new possibilities for innovation and growth.
